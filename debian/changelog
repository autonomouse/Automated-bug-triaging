doberman (2.1.3-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Removed the (oil-)stats way of selecting the appropriate builds to use and now instead completely relies upon the doberman system of selecting which builds to use from a given date-range.
  * Fixed refinery causing a red light in jenkins (was no longer returning 0 on completion). 
  * Now removes any pipelines that shouldn't be there when loading from paabn file (crude_test_catalog).

doberman (2.1.0-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Fixed the way we were merging dictionaries which resulted in the loss of some data (bug lp:1484426).
  * Fixed oil-stats so that it no longer gives such crazy overall results (bug lp:1452380).
  * Some housekeeping - all scripts are now based on Common, not CrudeAnalysis, and oil-stats renamed to stats and utilises the same common infrastructure.

doberman (1.3.0-0ubuntu1) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Can now run the bugs uploader via the 'updatabase' command.
  * Bugs uploader now only upload bugs if they have changed and removes bugs from the database if they have been removed from the yaml. It is now alo possible to purge all bugs from the database before you begin uploading.
  * Doberman now uses test-catalog to get the bug numbers rather than through jenkins.
  * Doberman now treats underscores as spaces when providing dates (useful for entering dates into jenkins build params which doesn't allow spaces or quotes)
  * Some changes to the way in which Doberman returns error codes - It's now a bit more consistent, although this still will need to be revisited at some point int he future, so we can get out red or blue lights on jenkins in the way taht everyone is happy with.
  * Finally linted filing-station, et al (thanks, Larry!)
  * Removed high-level generic bugs from mock_database yaml

doberman (1.0.11-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Missed a variable :-(
  * Made some changes to rematch for XML processing to eventually be able to handle the catch all ('*') given as the target_file, but this still will not work for tempest as there is a bug where if there are multiple globs it overwrites these in the xml. Needs fixing.

doberman (1.0.9-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Fixed an issue with the way that refinery handled large tempest xml elements. Refinery is now vastly quicker.
  * Minor bug-fixes for no data in oil-stats and updated the oil-ci-config charm for a value I missed.
  * Added an offline analysis mode in crude for when folders have been downloaded but weren't analysed for some reason (it's a bit of a misnomer really, as it's not actually entirely offline yet, but that's what it's called in refinery and I wanted to reuse the variable. It might be better being called work_on_folders mode or something?)
  * Some improvements made to crude's offline mode, although it still needs to be online to get missing console data.
  * There is now a dont replace option, so won't overwrite data already downloaded. 
  * Refinery now correctly deals with tempest data (rather than just using xml fail class and name)

doberman (1.0.6-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Refinery now works on folders with output files in top-level so can work on crude output run locally rather than over jenkins
  * Started to farm out some functionality into it's own methods and move the more generic methods into common with an aim to move to an API model in the future
  * Moved plotting methods out of refinery into it's own class. Also better plots (but only a bit better)
  * Tweeked progress reporting to user
  * Now does bug rankings for individual jobs too
  * Better refinery groupings
  * Bug fixes - keep data fix, fix for no data
  * Reports top 10 bugs to console. Added top ten output to refinery and number of duplicates to pie charts

  * Fixed a return message error with unfiled bugs.
  * Bug_hunt now works with a glob so multiple files can be checked (only reports the last one though - shouldn't be a problem as long as it finds *something*).
  * Second superfluous timestamp removed from output yaml.
  * Spaces added between 'started' and 'juju-machine' in 'states' in output yaml.
  * Moved get_yaml, etc to common (so refinery can use it, later).
  * Link to jenkins no longer uses internal IP, now uses need external jenkins URL.
  * Link to jenkins should now point to the right place.
  * Fixed overall success rate in oil stats.
  * Now works on a date range, so you can just ask it to give you the last 24 hours.
  * Updated mock bugs dictionary.

  * Added a bug to mock db file.
  * Fix for error seen on pipeline_start job 169 and similar jobs where uses a [] rather than a .get()
