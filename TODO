refinery
---------
    - Provide a method that takes in a dictionary and uses Gregs script (or a version of) to
    - Download all output yamls from a and put in a single (well, 3 single) yaml
    - climate_change_common should be in refinery, methinks...
    - METRICS!!! Number of unfiled bugs detected by crude, number of jobs jenkins performed, ratio of reoccurring bugs to one offs, stuff like that...
    - Take an unfiled bug and compare it against another unfiled bug - if 99% overlap, it's the same bug. Maybe look for "error" +/- 10 lines either side and do it with that? (after blanking out the build number, pipeline id, date, etc)

crude
-----
    - abstract out test-catalog and jenkins commands so can drop in a folder scanning replacement at a later date, etc...,

database
-----
    - add a juju_debug.log bug so it gets scanned too

climate change
--------------
    - Using the refinery method based on Greg's script, have a web-form to upload bugs
    - (climate_change_common should be in refinery, methinks...)
    - show me only unfiled bugs
    - show me charts of percentage of operating system, openstack version, name/type of machines run on, etc that this bug affects
    - display the refinery metrics
